---- SETTING UP THE DATABASE

1) First, open the txt file called PROJ_MUSIC_ORA_20211206_SQL and run it in the database to create all the tables.
2) Run the scl script called all_data_inserts.sql
3) If you would like to delete the database, run the code inside of drop_tables.txt


-- SETTING UP THE JAVA APPLICATION

1) Open the folder database-project-01 in VsCode.
2) Delete the existing settings.json and launch.json files.
3) Click on the file called SongDBJavaFx.
4) Then, at the bottom left, click on java projects, database-project-01, then at the bottom click Referenced Libraries.
5) Then, select the ojdbc.jar inside of the ojdbc file and add it.
6) Additonally, also add all of the jar files inside of the javafx folder.
7) Close VsCode and reopen it
8) Next click on the BIG run and debug icon on the BIG left side panel in VsCode and create a launch.json file. (Make sure that the java file that is open is the SONGDBjavafx.java)
9) add a , to the end of the line that contains project name in the launch.json and underneath it add
	            "vmArgs": [
                "--module-path",
                "write here the absolute path to the folder",
                "--add-modules=javafx.controls"
            ]
10) it should look something like this:
	{

    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "type": "java",
            "name": "Launch Current File",
            "request": "launch",
            "mainClass": "${file}"
        },
        {
            "type": "java",
            "name": "Launch SongDBJavaFX",
            "request": "launch",
            "mainClass": "Application.SongDBJavaFX",
            "projectName": "database-project-01_b95c12ca",
            "vmArgs": [
                "--module-path",
                "C:\\Users\\raaga\\Desktop\\DawsonClasses\\ComputerScience\\3rd_Semester\\Programming_3\\javafx-sdk-17.0.1\\lib",
                "--add-modules=javafx.controls"
            ]
        }
    ]
}

11) Finally to run the application, go to the SongDBjavafx.java file and scroll to the main method and click run. The javaFx application should then open. 
12) If it doesn't don't hesitate to send us a mio and maybe we can set up a zoom call for us to show a demo of our working program or have us help you set it up
